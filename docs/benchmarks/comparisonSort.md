# Comparison Sort (SORT):

Given a sequence of elements of any (uniform) type and a
comparison function over the elements, sort the elements into
ascending order.  The elements consists of a key and possible
auxiliary data, and the comparison function must define a total order
over the keys.  The sort need not be stable.  The code must not take
advantage of the specific type beyond the comparison function.

### Default Input Distributions

Currently the default size is 100 Million elements.   The small size
is 10 million elements.  The distributions are as follows:

- Double precision floating point numbers generated uniformly at random from the range [0:1].

- Double precision floating point numbers generated at random with
repeats appearing in an *exponential* distribution, as generated by the
generator `exptSeq -t double`.

- Double precision floating point numbers from an *almost-sorted*
distribution, as generated by the generator `almostSortedSeq -t double`.

- Pairs of double precision floating point numbers each generated
uniformly at random from the range [0:1].  To be sorted on just the
first element of the pair.

- Strings from a tri-gram distribution, as generated by the generator
`trigramSeq`.

### Input and Output File Formats 

The input and output data need to be in the sequence file format, both with the same element type.  The output file 
must be in sorted order with respect to the given comparison function.
