# pbbsbench

The Problem Based Benchmark Suite (PBBS) is a collection of over 20
benchmarks defined in terms of their IO characteristics.  They are
designed to make it possible to compare different algorithms, or
implementations in different programming languages.  The emphasis is
on parallel algorithms.  Our default implementations are for
shared-memory multicore machines, although we would be delighted if
others implemented versions on GPUs or distributed machines and made
comparisons.

Information on the organization and on how to run PBBS can be found on
[this page](https://cmuparlay.github.io/pbbsbench).
